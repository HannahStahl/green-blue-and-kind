    "We have chosen to be a Public Benefit Corporation because we care about so many more shades of green than the color of money. A portion of profits is set aside to fund animal, human and environmental improvement efforts. We don't just want to protect the environment and animals, we want to contribute to a future where the earth and animals do not need protecting."
